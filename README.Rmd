ElevDistr is a method to calculate the distance to the climatic tree
line for large data sets of coordinates (WGS 84) with geographical
uncertainty. This R package was developed in the context of the article
"[Avoiding impacts of phylogenetic tip-state-errors on dispersal and extirpation rates in alpine plant biogeography](https://doi.org/10.1111/jbi.14811)".
For citing this package see [below](#how-to-cite-this-work).
The default thresholds and the treeline definition is based
on Paulsen and Körner, _Alp. Bot._ 124: 1-12 (2014), users are free to
decide what climate layers they would like to use.
